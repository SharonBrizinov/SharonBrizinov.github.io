## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.png">

Hi! My name is Sharon Brizinov and I am a security researcher focusing mainly on vulnerability research and ICS/SCADA security. My [CVEs](https://sharonbrizinov.com/cves) page contains most of the vulnerabilities I have found. In addition, I participated in Pwn2Own 2020 and hold a [DEFCON black badge](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html) which I won in a CTF competition at DEFCON 27.

Besides security research, I also like to develop mobile applications and games. You can find most of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sharonbrizinov).
